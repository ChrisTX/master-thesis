The implementation is given in the form of a C++14 header-only library.
It is capable of handling various formulations treated in the accompanying thesis.
More specifically, the C++ file "CubeTest.cpp" implements all the various test setups that were used and solves them using the library.
In order to run the code, one has to compile this file only after setting the correct parameters in the file for the specific test case in the file's header.

For compiling the code, one needs two libraries installed and available with headers:
- VTK
- Intel(R) MKL
Especially because the latter is non-trivial to link, we cannot provide a makefile that would work with the code.
The specific version of MKL installed and the operating system used greatly vary the link and compiler parameters required.
Intel provides a guide on how to link the library, which can be found under https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor/
